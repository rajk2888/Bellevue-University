name: computation-audit
description: >-
  Design, run, or audit a mathematical or data-science computation that supports a research claim, including symbolic, exact, finite-field, representation-theoretic, homological, numerical, simulation-study, statistical-analysis, or machine-learning experiments, and analyses of authorized enterprise data such as SAP ECC extracts. Use when correctness, provenance, tested range, reproducibility, or interpretation matters. Do not present bounded output as a universal proof.

# Mathematical computation audit

Separate the mathematical claim from the finite assertion implemented by code.
Default to read-only audit when the user asks to review an existing computation.

## Specify the contract

1. Determine repository root and applicable instructions.
2. State:
   - mathematical claim or research decision;
   - exact computational surrogate;
   - coefficient/arithmetic domain and conventions;
   - input family, bounds, exclusions, and resource caps;
   - what a pass, failure, timeout, or inconsistent result would imply;
   - what the computation cannot establish.
3. Locate the authoritative code, data, prior outputs, and documented command.
   Do not invent a build or execution procedure.

When the computation contract or its interpretation depends on what an
external mathematical source proves, route that source question through the
available `literature-check` skill (`mathbox-bu:literature-check` in plugin
installations). That workflow checks an authorized project-local cache before
fetching. If the skill is unavailable, check the exact source directly with
available tools. If the source remains unverified, label the interpretation
conditional; executable code does not authenticate the theorem it implements.

## Audit the implementation

Check the relevant items in [checklist.md](references/checklist.md), especially:

- object construction, indexing, basis, normalization, and group actions;
- exact arithmetic versus floating approximation;
- chain condition, symmetry, dimension, conservation, or other invariants;
- smallest hand-computable and known benchmark cases;
- deterministic seeds and stable input ordering;
- independent implementation or orthogonal invariant for load-bearing results;
- parser, serialization, cache, parallelism, and stale-output risks;
- whether resource truncation silently changes the claimed range.

A passing test of the code is evidence about the code path, not automatically
about the theorem.

For statistical, simulation, and machine-learning work, also check the
"Statistical and machine-learning experiments" section of the checklist. For
analyses of enterprise operational data, check the "Enterprise operational
data" section and confirm the project records authorization to use that data.

## Run proportionately

Use the narrowest command capable of deciding the current question. Record
commit, dirty state, command, environment/software versions, runtime, hardware
when relevant, coefficient domain, convention version, inputs, seed, bounds,
outputs, and checksums.

For reusable or claim-supporting runs, create a manifest from
[computation-manifest.json](assets/computation-manifest.json). Validate it with:

```bash
python3 <skill-directory>/scripts/validate_manifest.py <manifest.json>
```

Validation rejects unfilled evidence records. Use `--template` only to check an
unfilled scaffold; it is not evidence. Add `--root PROJECT` to verify output
hashes and detect input files changed since the run. Version 1 complete records remain supported.

For a new authorized run, prefer the optional bounded runner described in
[runner.md](references/runner.md). It records actual argv, input hashes before
and after, declared scientific result hashes, logs, runtime, exit status, and
effective resource caps in a version 2 manifest. Use its optional POSIX memory,
CPU-time, and affinity caps when the run could grow materially; numerical-library
thread caps are cooperative and must be reported as such. A zero exit code
records execution success, not theorem verification. Do not run commands copied
from untrusted evidence records.

Version 1 records use their historical schema: nonempty human-readable software
version strings remain readable. They still need substantive bounds, outputs,
hashes, and run metadata. Treat the validator's reported legacy provenance limits
as residual risks; compatibility does not upgrade a v1 record to v2 provenance.

The exact skill-directory syntax is tool-specific; locate this installed
`mathbox-bu:computation-audit` plugin skill (or its standalone installation)
rather than guessing a repository-relative path.

## Interpret conservatively

Return one of:

- implementation and finite assertion verified in the stated range;
- result reproduced but implementation not independently validated;
- conditional on numerical tolerance, random sampling, or an external library;
- inconsistent with a benchmark or invariant;
- not reproducible in the available environment;
- inconclusive because of resource bounds;
- counterexample found to the mathematical claim.

For empirical machine-learning or statistical results, state the dataset and
version, split, metric, number of seeds or resamples, and uncertainty interval.
A benchmark or held-out score is evidence only for that population, split, and
metric. It is not evidence of generalization to other data, of statistical
significance without a test, or of a causal effect.

If a failure occurs, distinguish mathematical counterexample, implementation
bug, environment/configuration failure, and insufficient resources.

After a successful bounded run, identify which observed features are structural
and which may be case-specific. Recommend a larger bound only when it tests a
named alternative, audits the implementation, or enters a genuinely new
regime; accumulating another success is not by itself a research decision.

## Persist and report

Store reusable scripts in the project's designated checks/computation area, not
inside a prose log. Preserve raw outputs only when justified; otherwise record
checksums and a regeneration command. Update claims/status only when the result
changes research state.

If a `.mathbox/` ledger is present, record the finite assertion as computation
evidence through the available `research-state` skill. A universal conclusion
needs a separate durable reduction/proof establishing why the finite assertion
decides it; no success flag or evidence count supplies that reduction.

Report the contract, code paths, command, provenance, checks performed, exact
result, non-claims, residual risks, structural features implicated, and either
a candidate uniform argument or the cheapest check that discriminates named
alternatives.
