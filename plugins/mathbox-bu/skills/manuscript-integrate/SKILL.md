description: >-
  Integrate an already validated mathematical result, correction, citation, or referee response into an authoritative LaTeX manuscript, dissertation chapter, or research paper while preserving hypotheses, evidence status, notation, and dependencies. Use only when the user explicitly requests manuscript integration. Do not use to invent a proof or to perform routine copyediting.

# Manuscript integration

Transfer validated mathematics into the live manuscript. Integration does not
supply mathematical validation or human review.

## Preconditions

1. Determine repository root, inspect the worktree, and read applicable
   instructions.
2. Resolve the authoritative manuscript, proof source, current status/claims,
   conventions, literature ledger, bibliography, and verification commands.
3. Identify the exact validated result and its evidence/review status.
   If `.mathbox/` is present, use the available `research-state` workflow to
   check the current claim revision, artifact freshness and dependency closure.
   Read the proof itself; a generated `proved` label does not validate it.
4. Stop if the source proof conflicts with current status or the target
   manuscript is ambiguous.
5. If a required external theorem has not been checked, pause integration and
   route that source question through the available `literature-check` skill
   (`mathbox-bu:literature-check` in plugin installations). That workflow checks an
   authorized project-local cache before fetching. Resume only after the exact
   source implication is verified. If the skill is unavailable, perform the
   exact-source check directly. If the source remains unavailable, keep that
   result conditional rather than supplying validation here. Continue any
   independent, already validated integration work the user authorized.

## Build the integration map

State:

- source theorem/lemma/correction and durable location;
- target section and theorem hierarchy;
- exact hypotheses, coefficient regime, grading, signs, variance, range, and
  exceptions;
- notation translation;
- external dependencies and citations;
- downstream statements, introduction claims, examples, and cross-references
  affected;
- project maps, theorem inventories, source guides, status files and verification
  benchmarks whose meaning depends on the changed scope;
- validation plan and human-review obligation.

## Edit

- Change the smallest coherent manuscript region.
- Keep hypotheses adjacent to the claim and preserve every limitation.
- Distinguish internal proof, external input, computation, heuristic, and open
  question.
- Do not make a publishable theorem depend accidentally on an optional stronger
  conjecture or unfinished route.
- Preserve historical source files; correct the live manuscript and record the
  correction rather than rewriting chronology.
- Update notation, theorem names/numbers, references, citations, introduction,
  comparison, and outlook only where the result requires it.
- For a scope removal or restriction, search every project-declared dependent
  view before claiming consistency. Update authorized dependents together; if a
  protected or separately governed file cannot be changed, mark the exact
  conflict in the live view and do not report the propagation complete.
- Do not edit generated output or bibliography entries without checking the
  project's source convention.

Use [integration-checklist.md](references/integration-checklist.md) for
load-bearing theorem changes.

## Synchronize durable state

When the mathematical state changes, update the durable proof, claims/status,
one standalone research record, and its compact history-index entry together.
Use the project-designated paths, or `research/records/` and `RESEARCH_LOG.md`
by default. Do not put route details in the index, rewrite indexed history, or
log routine prose or formatting. Keep any specialist or human-review obligation
open until it has actually occurred.

## Verify

1. Perform a conservative pass with the `mathbox-bu:proofread-math` plugin skill
   over the changed TeX and needed context.
2. Run the documented targeted mathematical verifier.
3. Run the appropriate out-of-tree or canonical manuscript build.
4. Inspect undefined references/citations, warnings in the changed region,
   theorem numbering, bibliography changes, and `git diff --check`.
5. Search for the superseded statement, scope and terminology across declared
   dependents; classify each remaining occurrence as current, historical or
   stale.
6. Review the final diff for unintended semantic or generated-file changes.

## Dissertation and course-paper deliverables

When the target is a Bellevue University dissertation chapter or course paper,
follow the template, chapter structure, and citation style the project charter
records from the program, instructor, or committee; do not infer them from a
generic template. Keep the student's authorship and voice: integrate validated
results and wording the student has approved, not new argumentative prose. If
the charter records an AI-use disclosure requirement, list what AI assistance
contributed to this integration so the student can disclose it.

## Report

Report the integrated result, files changed, source evidence, claim/status
changes, commands and warnings, unresolved mathematical or manuscript risk,
remaining human (advisor/committee) review, and any AI-assistance disclosure
note required by the charter.
